### Completed
 - [Machine learning Data Readiness](https://www.aws.training/Details/eLearning?id=34084) Boo. Learned nothing. Just high level intro to KNIME Analytics platform. No reason why this should be an AWS training. Uses an EC2 instance but could just as well have downloaded a binary from their website.
 - [Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/)
 - [Seven habits of highly effective Jenkins users](https://www.slideshare.net/andrewbayer/seven-habits-of-highly-effective-jenkins-users-2014-edition/45-Jenkins_User_Conference_San_Francisco)
